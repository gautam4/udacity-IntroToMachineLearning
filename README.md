# Udacity IntroToMachineLearning Course Project

## Introduction 
This repository contains projects completed as part of Udacity's Introduction to Machine Learning Course. More information on the course can be found [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120). The projects apply machine learning to analyze email data from the Enron dataset, containing emails and financial records from Enron. 

## Getting Started 
* The code included in this repository is not designed to run in a specific environment. To run this code in a specific environment, further modification may be required.
1. Run vectorize_text.py to download and store the email data
2. Any of the other code files can now be run

## Machine Learning Algorithms
* dt_author_id.py
    * A decision tree approach to author identification
* finance_regression.py
    * Regression analysis of financial data
* find_signature.py
    * A decision tree classifier
* nb_author_id.py
    * A naive bayes classifier for author identification
* poi_identifier_decisionTree.py
    * A decision tree approach to identifying a person of interest using both email and income data. This was completed as part of the course's final project.
